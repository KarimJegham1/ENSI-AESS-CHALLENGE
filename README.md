this directory contains a file that leads to a notebook of the machine-learning model that classify different rocks on the surface of the moon. This notebook contains notes that clarify every function used. It also contains a file that contains the 3D model named '3D-model'. Finally it contains a files that leads to the video of the simulation to describe the video more.

About the model, the nasa dataset needs an authorisation to scrape it from its site so i used a data of earth that i took from kaggle and here is the link to it"https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/salmaneunus/rock-classification".I made 5 sub-directories based on NASA's classification of moon rocks. In each sub-directory i put a certain earth's samples And the path of the data-scraping is the same as the main path I am using. The
